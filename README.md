Project details:

I have performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data, delving into the state of restaurants in Bangalore. The analysis encompasses trends in various localities, including the prevalence of hotels, the availability of online ordering and table booking facilities. Additionally, I have classified each location based on restaurant types and examined the distribution of online order facilities across different areas. Moreover, the exploration has identified the top cuisines in Bangalore, leveraging voting data.

Expected Outcome:

This analysis can be really helpful for anyone thinking about opening a new restaurant in Bangalore. It gives clear ideas about the best types of restaurants and where they should be located for success. This information is also useful for making smart decisions about how to cater to people's preferences and stand out in Bangalore's diverse food scene.
